         "## Understanding the Input Stream\n\nSince the operator is \"Scan\", I need to examine the database schema to determine which table contains the columns requested by the question. The question asks for \"the total number of horses of all farms.\"\n\nLooking at the schema, I can see there's a `farm` table that contains a `Total_Horses` column, which directly corresponds to what the question is asking for. The `farm` table has columns including `Farm_ID`, `Year`, `Total_Horses`, `Working_Horses`, and other livestock counts. Since the question specifically asks for horse information from farms, the `farm` table is the appropriate choice.\n\nThe final QPL line so far is: `#1 = Scan Table [ farm ]`\n\n## Operator-Specific Options\n\nFor the Scan operator, I need to consider:\n\n- **Predicate filtering**: The question asks for \"all farms\" without any filtering conditions, so no predicate is needed.\n- **Distinct values**: The question doesn't specify that duplicate values should be removed, and since we want the total horses from each farm, duplicates are acceptable.\n\nSince no filtering is required and distinct values are not requested, no additional options are needed for this Scan operation.\n\nThe final QPL line so far is: `#1 = Scan Table [ farm ]`\n\n## Output Column Selection\n\nThe question asks for \"the total number of horses of all farms.\" Looking at the `farm` table, there's a `Total_Horses` column that directly matches this requirement. This column contains the total horse count for each farm, which is exactly what the question is requesting.\n\nThe final QPL line is: `#1 = Scan Table [ farm ] Output [ Total_Horses ]`",
         "#1 = Scan Table [ farm ] Output [ Total_Horses ]"
        ],
        [
         "49",
         "farm",
         null,
         "List the total number of horses on farms in ascending order.",
         "#1 = Scan Table [ farm ] Output [ Total_Horses ] ; -- List the total number of horses of all farms.",
         "Sort",
         "## Understanding the Input Stream\n\nThe input stream for this final line is #1, which scans the farm table and outputs the Total_Horses column. Based on the comment, #1 provides \"the total number of horses of all farms\" - this gives us a stream of Total_Horses values, one for each farm in the database.\n\nThe final QPL line so far is: #2 = Sort [ #1 ]\n\n## Operator-Specific Options\n\nSince we're using the Sort operator, I need to determine the sorting criteria:\n\n- **By which column**: The question asks to list total number of horses \"in ascending order\", so we need to sort by the Total_Horses column, which is the only column available from input stream #1.\n- **Sort direction**: The question explicitly states \"ascending order\", so we use ASC direction.\n\nThe final QPL line so far is: #2 = Sort [ #1 ] OrderBy [ Total_Horses ASC ]\n\n## Output Column Selection\n\nThe question asks to \"List the total number of horses on farms\", which means we need to output the Total_Horses column. This column is available from the input stream #1, so we can include it in the output.\n\nThe final QPL line is: #2 = Sort [ #1 ] OrderBy [ Total_Horses ASC ] Output [ Total_Horses ]",
         "#2 = Sort [ #1 ] OrderBy [ Total_Horses ASC ] Output [ Total_Horses ]"
